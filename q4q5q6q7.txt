q4 what is the difference between ++i and i++?
//
++i is precrement operation whereas i++ is postincrement operation.
i.e, in ++i the value of the i will be incremented before evaluating any expression
IN i++    the expression will be evaluated first with initial value of i,then the value of i is incremented.

eg:
int i=5;
a=++i;
value of i will be incremented first to 6 then it is assigned to a
so (a=6)

int i=5;
a=i++;
value of i will be assigned to a then i value is incremented;
so a=5 and i=6




Q5 In a for loop, and can be statements more complicated than declaring, initializing, and updating a loop-control variable. How can I take advantage of this ability?

in for-loop there are three basic expressions that are evaluated:initialing,conditional statement and updating(like incrementing)

the syntax for for-loop
for(intilization,condition,updation)

it is also possible to skip initialization part if the loop variable is already declared and intialized;
eg:

int i=0;
for(;i<10;i+=2)

we can make the for loop to run infinite number of times.
eg;
for( ; ; )

or we can skip the conditional part in for loop and add some break stmt to come out of the for loop

eg:
for(int i=1; ; i++)
{
if(i==5)
break;
}
this loop will iterate for 5 times and when i=5 control will come out of the for loop

it is also possible to use several varaibles in for loop using comma operator
it is alo possible to use logical operator  lke && ,|| in the conditional expression..
eg:
for(int i=0,j=0 ;i<5 && j<10  ;j++,i++)


for-each loop
this is more convenient to use than conventional for loop to iterate over collections like arraylist,linkedlist etc;
syntax:

for (varibale_type var:collection)




q6 Can I use a double variable as a loop-control variable in a for loop?

Yes it is completely possible to use double variable in a for loop....these variables should be separated by commas.
and if it required to control the loop based on the values of both the variables then the conditional expressions can be chained via logical operators
like && or ||

eg:
for(int i=0,j=0;i<10 && j<5;j++,i++)
{

}


Q7.Are there cases where I must use a for loop but not a while, or vice versa?

It is absolutely fine to use for and while interchangebly,but there are situations where the use of these loops is restricted to only one.i.e either for or while.

for loop is basically used when the number of iterations is known prior.
where as while loop is used when the no of iterations is not known.i.e it depends on the value(result) of some expressions
